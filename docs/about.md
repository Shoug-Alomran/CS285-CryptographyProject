# About the Project

The **Secure Key Exchange System** was developed as part of the **CS285 – Discrete Mathematics for Computing** course at **Prince Sultan University**.

This website presents the full report, source code, and implementation details of the project.  
It demonstrates how two participants can securely establish a shared secret key using the **Diffie–Hellman key exchange algorithm**, implemented entirely in **Java**.

## Purpose of the Project

The project’s objective is to:

1. Apply mathematical concepts of modular arithmetic and discrete logarithms.  
2. Demonstrate secure key exchange using the **Diffie–Hellman algorithm**.  
3. Illustrate how the shared key enables message encryption and decryption.  
4. Reinforce understanding of public-key cryptography fundamentals.

!!! note "Educational Goal"
    This project serves as both a **learning tool** and a **proof-of-concept**, bridging the gap between mathematical theory and secure software implementation.
