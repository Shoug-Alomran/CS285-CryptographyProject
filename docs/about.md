# About the Project

<div class="purpose-note"><strong>Purpose:</strong> Define the project scope and explain how the CS285 implementation connects theory with working software.</div>

The **Secure Key Exchange System** was developed for **CS285 - Discrete Mathematics for Computing** at **Prince Sultan University**.

The website consolidates the project report, implementation notes, source code references, and test outcomes. The core demonstration shows how two participants establish a shared secret key using **Diffie-Hellman** in **Java**.

## Project Purpose

This project was designed to:

1. Apply modular arithmetic and discrete logarithm concepts in a practical setting.
2. Implement Diffie-Hellman key exchange with clear parameter handling.
3. Show how a shared secret can support encryption and decryption.
4. Reinforce core public-key cryptography principles through reproducible examples.

!!! note "Educational Scope"
    This implementation is an instructional proof-of-concept intended to bridge mathematical foundations and software execution.
