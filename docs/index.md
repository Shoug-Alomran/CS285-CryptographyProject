# Implementation & Analysis of the Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange (Java)

**College of Computer and Information Sciences (CCIS) — CS285: Discrete Mathematics for Computing**  
**Course Instructor:** Dr. Jalila Zouhair 
**Section:** 963

> This site presents our Java implementation of the Diffie–Hellman (DH) key exchange with a lightweight
> message encryption demo. It includes background, code, results, and the full team contribution.

## What this includes
- A clear walkthrough of \( q \), \( \alpha \), private/public keys, and the shared secret.
- Two numerical examples (fixed values from the report + randomly generated).
- Live mode with manual or auto parameters and keys.
- Encryption/decryption of a message (> 20 chars) using the shared key.
- Screenshots of success/validation cases and the full Java source.

!!! tip "How to run"
    ```bash
